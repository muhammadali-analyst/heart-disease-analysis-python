# heart-disease-analysis-python
Performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and correlation study to identify key features influencing heart disease. Separated categorical/continuous variables, visualized gender-based insights, and prepared data for future predictive modeling

# Python Dashboard Portfolio

This repository contains an interactive dashboard built in python using different libraries like pandas,seaborn,matplotlib  for analyzing and visualizing Heart Disease Analysis data.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

- **Tool Used:** Jupyter notebook using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Features:** Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation heatmap, visual insights
- **Purpose:** Understand which features affect heart disease and prepare the dataset for predictive modeling
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Data preprocessing, statistical analysis, visualization, feature exploration

## ðŸ’¡ Insights

# Some of the key findings from this analysis:

Male Patients Have Higher Heart Disease Rates
Gender-based analysis shows men are affected more than women in this dataset.

Blood Pressure and Cholesterol Levels Are Important Indicators
Continuous variable distributions show abnormal resting blood pressure and cholesterol values are more common among patients with heart disease.

Strong Feature Correlations Identified
The correlation heatmap highlights relationships among variables, such as age and blood pressure, which are useful for predictive modeling.
